Some problems from dailycodingproblem.com are solved using Golang.

Some effort have been made to make the documentation look good with godoc. To see the documentation, run
```bash
godoc -http=:3000
```
and use a browser to view at localhost:3000.

All problems has a test-suite. Run the tests with 
```bash
go test ./...
``` 
in the repository root-directory. It is also possible to track the test coverage by: 
```bash
go test ./... -cover
```
Even better, you can write
```bash
go test ./... -coverprofile=cp.out && go tool cover -html=cp.out
```
in order to get an html-document in the browser which code are covered by the tests.

My three favorite solutions are number 2, 30 and 40. Problem number 2 computes the product of all numbers in a slice, except
for the current entry. This is trivial as long as there are no zero entries. For zero entries it becomes quite interesting. I solved the problem with a divide and conquer algorithm. Problem number 30 consider a 2D topography, and how rain water are trapped after a very heavy rainfall that fills any topography. The task is to do this in O(N) time, and O(1) space. It took a lot of thinking, but finally (several hours later) I came up with a solution. Problem number 40 has a slice with triplets except for one single entry. The task is to find this single entry. I use some interesting modulo-arithmetics, that will be slow in reality, but still fulfil the complexity requirement, let be with a large constant when the entries are large.
